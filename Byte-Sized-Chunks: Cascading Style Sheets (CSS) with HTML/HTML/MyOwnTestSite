        In the altogether excellent 1951 volume The Wisdom of Insecurity: 
        A Message for an Age of Anxiety, Watts argues 
        that the root of our human frustration and daily anxiety is our 
        tendency to live for the future, which is an abstraction.

        If to enjoy even an enjoyable present we must have the assurance 
        of a happy future, we are “crying for the moon.” We have no such 
        assurance. The best predictions are still matters of probability 
        rather than certainty, and to the best of our knowledge every one 
        of us is going to suffer and die. If, then, we cannot live happily 
        without an assured future, we are certainly not adapted to living 
        in a finite world where, despite the best plans, accidents will 
        happen, and where death comes at the end.

        What keeps us from happiness, Watts argues, is our inability to 
        fully inhabit the present:
  </p>
    <div>
      <blockquote class="yellow-color background-blue large-font">
        The “primary consciousness,” the basic mind which knows reality 
        rather than ideas about it, does not know the future. It lives 
        completely in the present, and perceives nothing more than what 
        is at this moment. The ingenious brain, however, looks at that 
        part of present experience called memory, and by studying it is 
        able to make predictions. These predictions are, relatively, so 
        accurate and reliable (e.g., “everyone will die”) that the future 
        assumes a high degree of reality — so high that the present loses 
        its value.
        <br>
        But the future is still not here, 
        and cannot become a part of experienced reality until it is 
        present. Since what we know of the future is made up of purely 
        abstract and logical elements — inferences, guesses, deductions 
        — it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise 
        enjoyed. To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating 
        phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead. 
        This is why all the affairs of civilization are rushed, why 
        hardly anyone enjoys what he has, and is forever seeking more 
        and more. Happiness, then, will consist, not of solid and 
        substantial realities, but of such abstract and superficial 
        things as promises, hopes, and assurances.

  <p class="emphasis">
      Watts argues that our primary mode of relinquishing presence 
    is by leaving the body and retreating into the mind — that 
    ever-calculating, self-evaluating, seething cauldron of thoughts, 
    predictions, anxieties, judgments, and incessant meta-experiences 
    about experience itself. Writing more than half a century before 
    our age of computers, touch-screens, and the quantified self, Watts 
    admonishes:

    <div>
         <blockquote class="yellow-color background-blue large-font">
           The brainy modern loves not matter but measures, 
          no solids but surfaces.
          <br>  […]   <br>
          The working inhabitants of a modern city are people who live inside 
          a machine to be batted around by its wheels. They spend their days 
          in activities which largely boil down to counting and measuring, 
          living in a world of rationalized abstraction which has little 
          relation to or harmony with the great biological rhythms and 
          processes. As a matter of fact, mental activities of this kind can 
          now be done far more efficiently by machines than by men — so much 
          so that in a not too distant future the human brain may be an 
          obsolete mechanism for logical calculation. Already the human 
          computer is widely displaced by mechanical and electrical computers 
          of far greater speed and efficiency. If, then, man’s principal 
          asset and value is his brain and his ability to calculate, he will 
          become an unsaleable commodity in an era when the mechanical 
          operation of reasoning can be done more effectively by machines.
          <br>[…] <br>
          If we are to continue to live for the future, and to make the 
          chief work of the mind prediction and calculation, man must 
          eventually become a parasitic appendage to a mass of clockwork.

      To be sure, Watts doesn’t dismiss the mind as a worthless or 
      fundamentally perilous human faculty. Rather, he insists that it 
      if we let its unconscious wisdom unfold unhampered — like, for 
      instance, what takes place during the “incubation” stage of 
      unconscious processing in the creative process — it is our ally 
      rather than our despot. It is only when we try to control it and 
      turn it against itself that problems arise:
    </p>
    <blockquote id="favQuote">
      Working rightly, the brain is the highest form of “instinctual 
      wisdom.” Thus it should work like the homing instinct of pigeons 
      and the formation of the fetus in the womb — without verbalizing 
      the process or knowing “how” it does it. The self-conscious 
      brain, like the self-conscious heart, is a disorder, and 
      manifests itself in the acute feeling of separation between “I” 
      and my experience. The brain can only assume its proper behavior 
      when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing 
      and whirling to get out of present experience, but being 
      effortlessly aware of it.
